# PolishNotationSolver
A C++ project that computes mathematical expressions given in Polish notation(with paranthesis).

Parses numerical values as doubles.

This project was given to Bil142 students at TOBB ETU as 5th homework in the summer term of 2015.

## Examples
(+ 2 3) = 5

(* (+ 2 3) 3) = 15

(+ (* 3 3) (* 4 4)) = 25

(* (- (+ 0 0) (/ 5 10) ) 10 ) = -5

(+ (- 0.25 (* 0.5 0.5)) 100.5) = 100.5
